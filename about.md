Well, I am programmer who is curious about anything and everything that can be
done with computers.

My central attractions are Computer Security (I recognise the broadness of
the topic), Operating Systems and Programming Language Theory (of which I know
nothing ;) ).

I sometimes read fiction. I listen to classic rock and country rock but
otherwise open to new tastes. I take a passive interest in global politics and
am still sometimes taken by my childhood fantasies involving military weapons.

I am a avid TV Series (English) and movie watcher and love to reflect about the
hidden meaning and characterisations (I sometimes can see through the viewpoint
of the antagonist).
