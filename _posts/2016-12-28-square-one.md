So here I am! I always loved to write and share my thoughts with the world. But
there was always something more urgent or more interesting. Not that writing was
not but, honestly, I am a technical guy (as if that's a proper term ;P ). And
also I was afraid that I would make mistakes or someone might confront me for
something I wrote.

Here in another thing about confrontation. I believe that everyone has a right
to an opinion and so I dislike arguing over your opinion. If you don't see the
way I see or I can't see your version, maybe it's just because we have had
different experiences. We are what we are because of our experiences.

I believe that, since this is my first post, I should explain the title of the
blog! Well, as I was to write here anything I want without caring about the
repercussions or being judged it I am wrong. I know that everyone is entitled
to the consequences of one's actions, but these are the thoughts that would never
have left my mind. Let these words wander about the vast expanses of the
internet then get destroyed with time. I believe (maybe just like everyone)
these thoughts are too precious to get destroyed.

With this I bid thee goodbye with, what RMS had one said to me, "Happy Hacking!"
